whatever is the javascript equivalent of the input
if input >= 20:
    go on with the code
    make both rows and columns equal to the integer inputted by the user
    after creating the rows and columns, take a random value of row and column
    and make that random "coordinate" (row, col) be a user input field

else:
    somehow dont break things but dont run the code
